# Twitterick 

## Overview

**Twitterick** constructs limerick-style poems from tweets. Users have the choice of selecting a handle from a pre-populated list of Twitter personalities or entering their own to be used in the first line of a randomized poem. 

Rails 4 was used to build this project along with a Postgres database, the Twitter API and a number of Ruby gems. Nokogiri was used to query rhymes from Rhymezone.com.
